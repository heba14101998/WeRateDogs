# wrangle_WeRateDogs
The purpose of this project is to put in practice what I learned in data wrangling data section from Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
